This project analyzes luxury cosmetics pop-up events to uncover insights that drive sales and optimize inventory. Machine learning models predict units sold and flag high sell-through events. The analysis examines brands, cities, pricing, footfall, and lease duration. Key findings show that revenue per day, lease length, and product price are the strongest drivers of success, with premium products and shorter events performing best. These insights guide strategic decisions on pricing, location, and inventory planning. The project uses Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn for data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling.
